Dark theme (grey / green) for the Seafile server webinterface

Tested with Seafile Server 6.0.7.

## Information

**IMPORTANT:** The theme is in a very early alpha state. But If you want to give it a try and you are using the ***custom.css*** for the light theme, be sure you have a backup of the actual ***custom.css***.
